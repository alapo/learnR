# How to create a GitHub key

You are going to be installing packages from multiple sources. When installing a package for the first time you might need to install it from GitHub. It's a great source for packages that have not yet been released on CRAN. 

Under normal circumstances your ability to install packages from GitHub is limited. However you can create an authentication key which will give you unlimited power. I would highly suggest doing this during your setup.
