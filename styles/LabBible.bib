  abstract = {This review presents a practical primer for functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) with respect to technology, experimentation, and analysis software. Its purpose is to jump-start interested practitioners considering utilizing a non-invasive, versatile, nevertheless challenging window into the brain using optical methods. We briefly recapitulate relevant anatomical and optical foundations and give a short historical overview. We describe competing types of illumination (transillumination, reflectance, and differential reflectance) and data collection methods (continuous wave, time domain, and frequency domain). Basic components (light sources, detection, and recording components) of fNIRS systems are presented. Advantages and limitations of fNIRS techniques are offered, followed by a list of very practical recommendations for its use. A variety of experimental and clinical studies with fNIRS are sampled, shedding light on many brain-related ailments. Finally, we describe and discuss a number of freely available analysis and presentation packages suited for data analysis. In conclusion, we recommend fNIRS due to its ever-growing body of clinical applications, state-of-the-art neuroimaging technique, and manageable hardware requirements. It can be safely concluded that fNIRS adds a new arrow to the quiver of neuro-medical examinations due to both its great versatility and limited costs.},

  abstract = {Recently, interest has been growing to understand the underlying dynamic directional relationship between simultaneously activated regions of the brain during motor task performance. Such directionality analysis (or effective connectivity analysis), based on non-invasive electrophysiological (electroencephalography-EEG) and hemodynamic (functional near infrared spectroscopy-fNIRS; and functional magnetic resonance imaging-fMRI) neuroimaging modalities can provide an estimate of the motor task-related information flow from one brain region to another. Since EEG, fNIRS and fMRI modalities achieve different spatial and temporal resolutions of motor-task related activation in the brain, the aim of this study was to determine the effective connectivity of cortico-cortical sensorimotor networks during finger movement tasks measured by each neuroimaging modality. Nine healthy subjects performed right hand finger movement tasks of different complexity (simple finger tapping-FT, simple finger sequence-SFS, and complex finger sequence-CFS). We focused our observations on three cortical regions of interest (ROIs), namely the contralateral sensorimotor cortex (SMC), the contralateral premotor cortex (PMC) and the contralateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). We estimated the effective connectivity between these ROIs using conditional Granger causality (GC) analysis determined from the time series signals measured by fMRI (blood oxygenation level-dependent-BOLD), fNIRS (oxygenated-O2Hb and deoxygenated-HHb hemoglobin), and EEG (scalp and source level analysis) neuroimaging modalities. The effective connectivity analysis showed significant bi-directional information flow between the SMC, PMC, and DLPFC as determined by the EEG (scalp and source), fMRI (BOLD) and fNIRS (O2Hb and HHb) modalities for all three motor tasks. However the source level EEG GC values were significantly greater than the other modalities. In addition, only the source level EEG showed a significantly greater forward than backward information flow between the ROIs. This simultaneous fMRI, fNIRS and EEG study has shown through independent GC analysis of the respective time series that a bi-directional effective connectivity occurs within a cortico-cortical sensorimotor network (SMC, PMC and DLPFC) during finger movement tasks.},

  abstract = {The majority of studies support a role of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in the attentional control necessary for conflict resolution in the Stroop task; however, the time course of activation and the neural substrates underlying the Stroop task remain contentious. We used high-density EEG to record visual-evoked potentials from 16 healthy subjects while performing a manual version of the traditional Stroop colour-word task. Difference waveforms for congruent-control and incongruent-control conditions were similar in amplitude and had a similar spatial distribution in the time window of 260\textendash{}430~ms post stimulus onset. Source estimation indicated particularly middle cingulate involvement in congruent-control and incongruent-control difference waveforms. In contrast, the difference waveform for the incongruent-congruent contrast was observed later (in the time window of 370\textendash{}480~ms), had a different spatial distribution, and source estimation indicated that the anterior cingulate underlies this difference waveform. As congruent-control and incongruent-control differences have a similar timeframe and cingulate source, we propose that this indicates early attentional allocation processes. That is, the identification of two sources of information (the word and the colour it is printed in) and the selective attention to one. The later peak in the incongruent-congruent difference wave, originating in anterior cingulate, likely reflects identification (and subsequent resolution) of conflict in the two sources of information.},

  abstract = {Background:
The finger-tapping test is a commonly employed quantitative assessment tool used to measure motor performance in the upper extremities. This task is a complex motion that is affected by external stimuli, mood and health status. The complexity of this task is difficult to explain with a single average intertap-interval value (time difference between successive tappings) which only provides general information and neglects the temporal effects of the aforementioned factors.

Aims:
This study evaluated the time course of average intertap-interval values and the patterns of variation in both the right and left hands of right-handed subjects using a computer-based finger-tapping system.

Study Design:
Cross sectional study.

Methods:
Thirty eight male individuals aged between 20 and 28 years (Mean{$\pm$}SD = 22.24{$\pm$}1.65) participated in the study. Participants were asked to perform single-finger-tapping test for 10 seconds of test period. Only the results of right-handed (RH) 35 participants were considered in this study. The test records the time of tapping and saves data as the time difference between successive tappings for further analysis. The average number of tappings and the temporal fluctuation patterns of the intertap-intervals were calculated and compared. The variations in the intertap-interval were evaluated with the best curve fit method.

Results:
An average tapping speed or tapping rate can reliably be defined for a single-finger tapping test by analysing the graphically presented data of the number of tappings within the test period. However, a different presentation of the same data, namely the intertap-interval values, shows temporal variation as the number of tapping increases. Curve fitting applications indicate that the variation has a biphasic nature.

Conclusion:
The measures obtained in this study reflect the complex nature of the finger-tapping task and are suggested to provide reliable information regarding hand performance. Moreover, the equation reflects both the variations in and the general patterns associated with the task.},

NIRS and DOI offer the potential to quantify changes in deoxyhemoglobin (HbR) and total hemoglobin (HbT) concentration, thus enabling distinction of oxygen consumption and blood flow changes during brain activation. While the techniques implemented presently provide important results for cognition and the neurosciences through their relative measures of HbR and HbT concentrations, there is much to be done to improve sensitivity, accuracy, and resolution. In this paper, we review the advances currently being made and issues to consider for improving optical image quality. These include the optimal selection of wavelengths to minimize random and systematic error propagation in the calculation of the hemoglobin concentrations, the filtering of systemic physiological signal clutter to improve sensitivity to the hemodynamic response to brain activation, the implementation of overlapping measurements to improve image spatial resolution and uniformity, and the utilization of spatial prior information from structural and functional MRI to reduce DOI partial volume error and improve image quantitative accuracy.},

In this study, using a modified Eriksen flanker task, we have investigated how flankers have to be incongruent to target in order to produce an interference and whether and how this interference interacts with the one produced by Stimulus features overlap. To these aims, an Eriksen-like task employing oriented hands\textbackslash{}arrows has been designed to distinguish between two types of Stimulus-Response (S-R) interferences: one derived by a short-term association and one based on automatic processes. Stimulus-Stimulus (S-S) conflict has been also included in the same factorial design. Behavioral, Event Related Potential (ERP) and oscillatory activity data have been measured. Results revealed distinct S-S and automatic S-R effects on behavioral performance. ERP and Theta band power modulation results suggested an early frontal S-S conflict processing followed by a posterior simultaneous S-S and automatic S-R conflict processing. These findings provide evidence that, in presence of different conflicts, the sequence of stimulus identification and response selection could not move forward in a linear serial direction, but it may involve further effort, mirrored in posterior late components and response time prolongation.},

  abstract = {Objective The objective of this study was to assess the effects of long-term offshore work on cerebral oxygenation oscillations in sailors based on the wavelet phase coherence (WPCO) of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) signals.
Methods The fatigue severity scale (FSS) was first applied to assess the fatigue level of sailors and age-matched controls. Continuous recordings of NIRS signals were then obtained from the prefrontal lobes in 30 healthy sailors and 30 age-matched controls during the resting state. WPCO between the left and right prefrontal oscillations was analysed and Pearson correlation analysis was used to study the relationship between the FSS and the wavelet amplitude (WA), and between the FSS and the WPCO level.
Results The periodic oscillations of Delta (HbO2) signals were identified at six frequency intervals: I (0.6\textendash{}2 Hz); II (0.145\textendash{}0.6 Hz); III (0.052\textendash{}0.145 Hz); IV (0.021\textendash{}0.052 Hz); V (0.0095\textendash{}0.021 Hz); and VI (0.005\textendash{}0.0095 Hz). The WA in intervals I (F=8.823, p=0.004) and III (F=4.729, p=0.034) was significantly lower in sailors than that in the controls. The WPCO values of sailor group were significantly lower in intervals III (F=4.686, p=0.039), IV (F=4.864, p=0.036) and V (F=5.195, p=0.03) than those of the control group. In the sailor group, the WA in interval I (r=-0.799, p{$<$}0.01) and in interval III (r=-0.721, p{$<$}0.01) exhibited a negative correlation with the FSS. Also, the WPCO exhibited a negative correlation with the FSS in intervals III (r=-0.839, p{$<$}0.01), IV (r=-0.765, p{$<$}0.01) and V (r=-0.775, p{$<$}0.01) in the sailor group.
Conclusions The negative correlation between WA and FSS indicates that the lower oscillatory activities might contribute to the development of fatigue. The low WPCO in intervals III, IV and V represents a reduced phase synchronisation of myogenic, neurogenic and endothelial metabolic activities respectively and this may suggest a decline of cognitive function.},

A perplexing pattern exists, however, with conflict-driven adaptation emerging in several paradigms (e.g., Stroop, Simon) but not consistently in the  flanker task. The present experiments address the seemingly elusive presence of conflict adaptation in this task. Experiment 1 shows that a negative-priming-like slowing may be masking conflict adaptation in the flanker task. In Experiment 2, conflict adaptation was revealed when a larger stimulus set designed to reduce negative priming was implemented. Taken together, the findings indicate that a consideration of processes opposing conflict adaptation in the flanker task may help reconcile prior findings.},

Repeat measurements of regional cerebral blood flow were obtained in 10 individuals, ages 35 to 82 years (mean 52 years), at scanning sessions separated by 6 months. Although the functional neuroanatomy of hand movements has previously been investigated with PET by a number of groups, none has reported systematic investigation of the consistency of brain activation over an extended time. As expected, we found significant activation in the left precentral gyrus [Talairach coordinate (-32, -34, 52)], postcentral gyrus (-22, -48, 56), and supplementary motor area (SMA) (-2, -18, 52) at the initial study, consistent with previous studies in younger subjects. For the follow-up study we also found significant activation in the left precentral (-36, -28, 52) and postcentral (-28, -36, 52) gyri and in the SMA (2, -16, 56). Our group results demonstrate consistent anatomical location and extent of motor activation over time. More importantly, analysis of individuals confirmed the presence of consistent sites of activation in primary sensorimotor cortex and SMA over the 6-month interval in most subjects. A high degree of consistency in location of activation in the group, and within individuals, over time suggests that changes in loci of activation may be confidently monitored using the PET method. Evidence of individual differences in extent of activation over time highlights the need for caution when interpreting similar changes in patient studies.},

  abstract = {Electroencephalographic oscillations at 10 Hz (alpha and mu rhythms) are the most prominent rhythms observed in awake, relaxed (eye-closed) subjects. These oscillations may be considered as a marker of cortical inactivity or an index of the active inhibition of the sensory information. Different cortical sources may participate in the 10-Hz oscillation and appear to be modulated by the sensory context and functional demands. In microgravity, the marked reduction in multimodal graviceptive inputs to cortical networks participating in the representation of space could be expected to affect the 10-Hz activity. The effect of microgravity on this basic oscillation has heretofore not been studied quantitatively. Because the alpha rhythm has a functional role in the regulation of network properties of the visual areas, we hypothesised that the absence of gravity would affect its strength. Here, we report the results of an experiment conducted over the course of 3 space flights, in which we quantified the power of the 10-Hz activity in relation to the arrest reaction (i.e., in 2 distinct physiological states: eyes open and eyes closed). We observed that the power of the spontaneous 10-Hz oscillation recorded in the eyes-closed state in the parieto-occipital (alpha rhythm) and sensorimotor areas (mu rhythm) increased in the absence of gravity. The suppression coefficient during the arrest reaction and the related spectral perturbations produced by eye-opening/closure state transition also increased in on orbit. These results are discussed in terms of current theories on the source and the importance of the alpha rhythm for cognitive function.},

  abstract = {Background
Few studies of cognitive rehabilitation in multiple sclerosis (MS) have targeted working memory specifically.

Objective
We examined the effects of n-back working memory training on cognitive performance and brain function in patients with MS.

Methods
Patients with MS (n\,=\,12) and healthy controls (HC; n\,=\,12) underwent 20 sessions of n-back working memory training. Before and after training (pre- and posttest) cognitive event-related potential (ERP) measures were obtained during a 3-back task. In addition, a battery of cognitive tests was administered.

Results
Following n-back training, both MS patients and HCs showed significant improvement on tests of working memory, processing speed, complex attention, and reasoning ability. MS and HCs also exhibited an enhancement of N2 ERP component amplitude, and earlier N2 and P3 latencies, following n-back training.

Conclusions
Targeted training of working memory with the n-back task may improve cognitive function in MS. Enhancement of N2 ERP component amplitude and shorter N2 and P3 latency following training in patients with MS is consistent with plasticity of neural processes that are involved in working memory.},

These rapidly induced effects indicate interplay among perceptual, attentional, response-selection and social\textendash{}emotional networks; yet, the brain mechanisms underlying this are not well understood. This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural mechanism mediating the relationship between inhibitory control and emotional devaluation. Participants performed two tasks: (i) a Go/No-Go task in response to faces and (ii) a trustworthiness rating task involving the previously seen faces. No-Go faces were rated as significantly less trustworthy than Go faces. By examining brain activations during Task 1, behavioral measures and brain activations obtained in Task 2 could be predicted. Specifically, activity in brain areas during Task 1 associated with (i) executive control and response suppression (i.e. lateral prefrontal cortex) and (ii) affective responses and value representation (i.e. orbitofrontal cortex), systematically covaried with behavioral ratings and amygdala activity obtained during Task 2. The present findings offer insights into the neural mechanisms linking inhibitory processes to affective responses.},

  abstract = {Background: Tourette Syndrome (TS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with childhood-onset, with a typical decline in tic severity, as well as an increasing ability to suppress tics in late childhood and adolescence. These processes develop in parallel with general improvement of self-regulatory abilities, and performance monitoring during this age-span. Hence, changes in performance monitoring over time might provide insight into the regulation of tics in children and adolescents with TS., Method: We measured reaction time, reaction time variability, accuracy, and event-related potentials (ERP) in 17 children with TS, including 10 children with comorbid Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), 24 children with ADHD, and 29 typically developing children, using a modified Eriksen Flanker task in two testing sessions administered on average 4.5 years apart. We then compared task performance, as well as ERP components across groups, and over time using regression models., Results: Task performance improved in all groups with age, and behavioral differences between children with TS and controls diminished at second assessment, while differences between controls and children with ADHD largely persisted. In terms of ERP, the early P3 developed earlier in children with TS compared with controls at the first assessment, but trajectories converged with maturation. ERP component amplitudes correlated with worst-ever tic scores., Conclusions: Merging trajectories between children with TS and controls are consistent with the development of compensatory self-regulation mechanisms during early adolescence, probably facilitating tic suppression, in contrast to children with ADHD. Correlations between ERP amplitudes and tic scores also support this notion.},

We reanalyzed an existing data set that employed the Stroop task using functional magnetic resonance imaging [Milham et al., Brain Cogn 2002;49:277-296]. Although we found no changes in the behavioral measures of conflict from the first to the second half of task performance, we found a reliable reduction in the activity of the anterior cingulate cortex. This result suggests the lack of a strong relationship between behavioral measurements of conflict and anterior cingulate activity. A concomitant increase in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity was also found, which may reflect a tradeoff in the neural substrates involved in supporting conflict resolution, detection, or monitoring processes. A second analysis of the data revealed that the duration of an experiment can dramatically affect interpretations of the results, including the roles in which particular regions are thought to play in cognition. These results are discussed in relation to current conceptions of ACC's role in attentional control.

After the discovery in 1992 that the functional activation of the human cerebral cortex (due to oxygenation and hemodynamic changes) can be explored by NIRS, human functional brain mapping research has gained a new dimension. fNIRS or optical topography, or near-infrared imaging or diffuse optical imaging is used mainly to detect simultaneous changes in optical properties of the human cortex from multiple measurement sites and displays the results in the form of a map or image over a specific area. In order to place current fNIRS research in its proper context, this paper presents a brief historical overview of the events that have shaped the present status of fNIRS. In particular, technological progresses of fNIRS are highlighted (i.e. from single-site to multi-site functional cortical measurements (images)), introduction of the commercial multi-channel systems, recent commercial wireless instrumentation and more advanced prototypes.},

However, the interactions between these systems remain to be specified. The present study used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate how attentional focus can modulate the neural activity elicited by scenes that vary in emotional content. In a visual oddball task, aversive and neutral scenes were presented intermittently among circles and squares. The squares were frequent standard events, whereas the other novel stimulus categories occurred rarely. One experimental group [N=10] was instructed to count the circles, whereas another group [N=12] counted the emotional scenes. A main effect of emotion was found in the amygdala (AMG) and ventral frontotemporal cortices. In these regions, activation was significantly greater for emotional than neutral stimuli but was invariant to attentional focus. A main effect of attentional focus was found in dorsal frontoparietal cortices, whose activity signaled task-relevant target events irrespective of emotional content. The only brain region that was sensitive to both emotion and attentional focus was the anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG). When circles were task-relevant, the ACG responded equally to circle targets and distracting emotional scenes. The ACG response to emotional scenes increased when they were task-relevant, and the response to circles concomitantly decreased. These findings support and extend prominent network theories of emotion-attention interactions that highlight the integrative role played by the anterior cingulate.},

  abstract = {The visual color-word Stroop task is widely used in clinical and research settings as a measure of cognitive control. Numerous neuroimaging studies have used color-word Stroop tasks to investigate the neural resources supporting cognitive control, but to our knowledge all have used unimodal (typically visual) Stroop paradigms. Thus, it is possible that this classic measure of cognitive control is not capturing the resources involved in multisensory cognitive control. The audiovisual integration and crossmodal correspondence literatures identify regions sensitive to congruency of auditory and visual stimuli, but it is unclear how these regions relate to the unimodal cognitive control literature. In this study we aimed to identify brain regions engaged by crossmodal cognitive control during an audiovisual color-word Stroop task, and how they relate to previous unimodal Stroop and audiovisual integration findings. First, we replicated previous behavioral audiovisual Stroop findings in an fMRI-adapted audiovisual Stroop paradigm: incongruent visual information increased reaction time towards an auditory stimulus and congruent visual information decreased reaction time. Second, we investigated the brain regions supporting cognitive control during an audiovisual color-word Stroop task using fMRI. Similar to unimodal cognitive control tasks, a left superior parietal region exhibited an interference effect of visual information on the auditory stimulus. This superior parietal region was also identified using a standard audiovisual integration localizing procedure, indicating that audiovisual integration resources are sensitive to cognitive control demands. Facilitation of the auditory stimulus by congruent visual information was found in posterior superior temporal cortex, including in the posterior STS which has been found to support audiovisual integration. The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, often implicated in unimodal Stroop tasks, was not modulated by the audiovisual Stroop task. Overall the findings indicate that an audiovisual color-word Stroop task engages overlapping resources with audiovisual integration and overlapping but distinct resources compared to unimodal Stroop tasks.},

Here, we examined the possible differences between overt and covert responses during the PASAT task in 13 volunteers. Results showed similar activations in parietal and frontal brain areas during both versions of the task. The contrast between the two conditions (overt and covert) indicated that differences in these two methodologies were minimal. Unlike the covert condition, the overt version of the task obtained significant activations in the left superior and inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral occipital cortex, caudate nucleus and cerebellum. As expected, no significant overactivations were observed in the covert when compared with the overt condition. Discussion focuses on the lower cost of using verbal responses to monitor performance during the PASAT task, which might be generalisable to other frontal lobe tasks requiring discrete responses.},

We analyzed the spatial/temporal features and the amplitude of the optical signal induced by cerebral activation during these three paradigms. We consistently found an increase (decrease) in the cerebral concentration of oxy-hemoglobin (deoxy-hemoglobin) at the cortical side contralateral to the stimulated side. We observed an optical response to activation that was larger in size and amplitude during voluntary motor task compared to the other two stimulations. The ipsilateral response was consistently smaller than the contralateral response, and even reversed (i.e., a decrease in oxy-hemoglobin, and an increase in deoxy-hemoglobin) in the case of the electrical stimulation. We observed a systemic contribution to the optical signal from the increase in the heart rate increase during stimulation, and we made a first attempt to subtract it from the evoked hemoglobin signal.

  abstract = {Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) measures the functional hemodynamic response occurring at the surface of the cortex. Large pial veins are located above the surface of the cerebral cortex. Following activation, these veins exhibit oxygenation changes but their volume likely stays constant. The back-reflection geometry of the NIRS measurement renders the signal very sensitive to these superficial pial veins. As such, the measured NIRS signal contains contributions from both the cortical region as well as the pial vasculature. In this work, the cortical contribution to the NIRS signal was investigated using (1) Monte Carlo simulations over a realistic geometry constructed from anatomical and vascular MRI and (2) multimodal NIRS-BOLD recordings during motor stimulation. A good agreement was found between the simulations and the modeling analysis of in vivo measurements. Our results suggest that the cortical contribution to the deoxyhemoglobin signal change ({$\Delta$}HbR) is equal to 16-22\% of the cortical contribution to the total hemoglobin signal change ({$\Delta$}HbT). Similarly, the cortical contribution of the oxyhemoglobin signal change ({$\Delta$}HbO) is equal to 73-79\% of the cortical contribution to the {$\Delta$}HbT signal. These results suggest that {$\Delta$}HbT is far less sensitive to pial vein contamination and therefore, it is likely that the {$\Delta$}HbT signal provides better spatial specificity and should be used instead of {$\Delta$}HbO or {$\Delta$}HbR to map cerebral activity with NIRS. While different stimuli will result in different pial vein contributions, our finger tapping results do reveal the importance of considering the pial contribution.},

  abstract = {It is well known that working memory is one of the most vulnerable cognitive functions in elderly. However, little is known about the neuronal underpinnings and temporal dynamics of working memory mechanisms in healthy aging which are necessary to understand the age-related changes. To this end, 36 young and 36 old healthy individuals performed a 2-back task and a 0-back control task, while the electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Participants were instructed to press a response key whenever a target appeared and not to respond in case of nontargets. Expectedly, older participants showed considerably slower RTs and significantly higher rates of omitted targets and false alarms than young participants in the 2-back task, whereas no age-group difference in detection rate was found in the 0-back task. From the EEG event-related potentials as well as time-frequency plots were computed. The ERPs showed a general delay of the frontocentral N2, and an attenuation and delay of both the P3a and P3b in older versus younger adults. Importantly, the frontal P3a was reduced in older adults in the 2-back task. Time-frequency decomposition revealed consistently lower power in frontal theta (6 Hz) and parietal alpha (9\textendash{}11 Hz) frequency range in older versus younger adults whereas no age-related differences were found in the delta frequency range. Task unspecific reduction of posterior alpha in elderly was paralleled by a reduction of the P3b. In contrast, the older adults had a strongly reduced frontal theta power in the 2-back task, which parallels the P3a reduction in the ERPs. The widespread reduction of alpha may indicate that older adults needed to recruit more attentional resources for successful task performance, whereas reduced frontal theta may indicate that older adults are less able to recruit frontal resources related to top-down control with increasing task demands. This suggests a less efficient fronto-parietal network synchronicity in older individuals that leads to deficits in identification and maintenance of task relevant stimuli.},

The present randomized controlled study is aimed at evaluating the effects of different training methods on WM. A sample of 141 healthy older adults (mean age 70 years) was assigned to one of four groups: physical training, cognitive training, a social control group, and a no-contact control group. The participants trained for four months. Before and after the training, n-back task during an EEG recording was applied. The results show that cognitive training enhanced the target detection rate in the 2-back task. This was corroborated by an increased number of repeated digits in the backward digit-span test but not in other memory tests. The improvement of WM was supported by an increased P3a prior to a correct target and an increased P3b both in nontarget and target trials. No ERP effects in the physical and no-contact control groups were found, while a reduction of P3a and P3b was found in the social control group. Thus, cognitive training enhances frontal and parietal processing related to the maintenance of a stored stimulus for subsequent matching with an upcoming stimulus and increases allocation of cognitive resources. These results indicate that multidomain cognitive training may increase WM capacity and neuronal activity in older age.},

  abstract = {This study used a proportion congruency manipulation in the Stroop task in order to investigate, at the behavioral and brain substrate levels, the predictions derived from the Dual Mechanisms of Control (DMC) account of two distinct modes of cognitive control depending on the task context. Three experimental conditions were created that varied the proportion congruency: mostly incongruent (MI), mostly congruent (MC), and mostly neutral (MN) contexts. A reactive control strategy, which corresponds to transient interference resolution processes after conflict detection, was expected for the rare conflicting stimuli in the MC context, and a proactive strategy, characterized by a sustained task-relevant focus prior to the occurrence of conflict, was expected in the MI context. Results at the behavioral level supported the proactive/reactive distinction, with the replication of the classic proportion congruent effect (i.e., less interference and facilitation effects in the MI context). fMRI data only partially supported our predictions. Whereas reactive control for incongruent trials in the MC context engaged the expected fronto-parietal network including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex, proactive control in the MI context was not associated with any sustained lateral prefrontal cortex activations, contrary to our hypothesis. Surprisingly, incongruent trials in the MI context elicited transient activation in common with incongruent trials in the MC context, especially in DLPFC, superior parietal lobe, and insula. This lack of sustained activity in MI is discussed in reference to the possible involvement of item-specific rather than list-wide mechanisms of control in the implementation of a high task-relevant focus.},

  abstract = {Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) modulates cortical neural activity and hemodynamics. Electrophysiological methods (electroencephalography-EEG) measure neural activity while optical methods (near-infrared spectroscopy-NIRS) measure hemodynamics coupled through neurovascular coupling (NVC). Assessment of NVC requires development of NIRS-EEG joint-imaging sensor montages that are sensitive to the tDCS affected brain areas. In this methods paper, we present a software pipeline incorporating freely available software tools that can be used to target vascular territories with tDCS and develop a NIRS-EEG probe for joint imaging of tDCS-evoked responses. We apply this software pipeline to target primarily the outer convexity of the brain territory (superficial divisions) of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). We then present a computational method based on Empirical Mode Decomposition of NIRS and EEG time series into a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), and then perform a cross-correlation analysis on those IMFs from NIRS and EEG signals to model NVC at the lesional and contralesional hemispheres of an ischemic stroke patient. For the contralesional hemisphere, a strong positive correlation between IMFs of regional cerebral hemoglobin oxygen saturation and the log-transformed mean-power time-series of IMFs for EEG with a lag of about -15 s was found after a cumulative 550 s stimulation of anodal tDCS. It is postulated that system identification, for example using a continuous-time autoregressive model, of this coupling relation under tDCS perturbation may provide spatiotemporal discriminatory features for the identification of ischemia. Furthermore, portable NIRS-EEG joint imaging can be incorporated into brain computer interfaces to monitor tDCS-facilitated neurointervention as well as cortical reorganization.},

  abstract = {Mindfulness meditation as a therapeutic intervention has been shown to have positive effects on psychological problems such as depression, pain or anxiety disorders. In this study, we used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to detect differences in hemodynamic responses of meditation experts (14 participants) and a control group (16 participants) in a resting and a mindfulness condition. In both conditions, the sound of a meditation bowl was used to find group differences in the auditory system and adjacent cortical areas. Different lateralization patterns of the brain were found in expert meditators while being in a resting state (amplified left hemisphere) or being in mindfulness state (amplified right hemisphere). Compared to the control group, meditation experts had a more widespread pattern of activation in the auditory cortex, while resting. In the mindfulness condition, the control group showed a decrease of activation in higher auditory areas (BA 1, 6 and 40), whereas the meditation experts had a significant increase in those areas. In addition, meditation expert had highly activated brain areas (BA 39, 40, 44 and 45) beyond the meditative task itself, indicating possible long-term changes in the brain and their positive effects on empathy, meta cognitive skills and health.},

  abstract = {For cognitive processes to function well, it is essential that the brain is optimally supplied with oxygen and blood. In recent years, evidence has emerged suggesting that cerebral oxygenation and hemodynamics can be modified with physical activity. To better understand the relationship between cerebral oxygenation/hemodynamics, physical activity, and cognition, the application of state-of-the art neuroimaging tools is essential. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is such a neuroimaging tool especially suitable to investigate the effects of physical activity/exercises on cerebral oxygenation and hemodynamics due to its capability to quantify changes in the concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin (oxyHb) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (deoxyHb) non-invasively in the human brain. However, currently there is no clear standardized procedure regarding the application, data processing, and data analysis of fNIRS, and there is a large heterogeneity regarding how fNIRS is applied in the field of exercise\&ndash;cognition science. Therefore, this review aims to summarize the current methodological knowledge about fNIRS application in studies measuring the cortical hemodynamic responses during cognitive testing (i) prior and after different physical activities interventions, and (ii) in cross-sectional studies accounting for the physical fitness level of their participants. Based on the review of the methodology of 35 as relevant considered publications, we outline recommendations for future fNIRS studies in the field of exercise\&ndash;cognition science.},

  abstract = {Concussion, or mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), accounts for {$\sim$}80\% of all TBIs across North America. The majority of mTBI patients recover within days to weeks; however, 14-36\% of the time, acute mTBI symptoms persist for months or even years and develop into persistent post-concussion symptoms (PPCS). There is a need to find biomarkers in patients with PPCS, to improve prognostic ability and to provide insight into the pathophysiology underlying chronic symptoms. Recent research has pointed toward impaired network integrity and cortical communication as a biomarker. In this study we investigated functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) as a technique to assess cortical communication deficits in adults with PPCS. Specifically, we aimed to identify cortical communication patterns in prefrontal and motor areas during rest and task, in adult patients with persistent symptoms. We found that (1) the PPCS group showed reduced connectivity compared with healthy controls, (2) increased symptom severity correlated with reduced coherence, and (3) connectivity differences were best distinguishable during task and in particular during the working memory task (n-back task) in the right and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). These data show that reduced brain communication may be associated with the pathophysiology of mTBI and that fNIRS, with a relatively simple acquisition paradigm, may provide a useful biomarker of this injury.},

  abstract = {Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was originally designed for clinical monitoring of tissue oxygenation, and it has also been developed into a useful tool in neuroimaging studies, with the so-called functional NIRS (fNIRS). With NIRS, cerebral activation is detected by measuring the cerebral hemoglobin (Hb), where however, the precise correlation between NIRS signal and neural activity remains to be fully understood. This can in part be attributed to the situation that NIRS signals are inherently subject to contamination by signals arising from extracerebral tissue. In recent years, several approaches have been investigated to distinguish between NIRS signals originating in cerebral tissue and signals originating in extracerebral tissue. Selective measurements of cerebral Hb will enable a further evolution of fNIRS. This chapter is divided into six sections: first a summary of the basic theory of NIRS, NIRS signals arising in the activated areas, correlations between NIRS signals and fMRI signals, correlations between NIRS signals and neural activities, and the influence of a variety of extracerebral tissue on NIRS signals and approaches to this issue are reviewed. Finally, future prospects of fNIRS are described.},

  abstract = {In this study, we have preformed simultaneous near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) along with BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent) and ASL (arterial spin labeling)-based fMRI during an event-related motor activity in human subjects in order to compare the temporal dynamics of the hemodynamic responses recorded in each method. These measurements have allowed us to examine the validity of the biophysical models underlying each modality and, as a result, gain greater insight into the hemodynamic responses to neuronal activation. Although prior studies have examined the relationships between these two methodologies through similar experiments, they have produced conflicting results in the literature for a variety of reasons. Here, by employing a short-duration, event-related motor task, we have been able to emphasize the subtle temporal differences between the hemodynamic parameters with a high contrast-to-noise ratio. As a result of this improved experimental design, we are able to report that the fMRI measured BOLD response is more correlated with the NIRS measure of deoxy-hemoglobin (R = 0.98; P {$<$} 10(-20)) than with oxy-hemoglobin (R = 0.71), or total hemoglobin (R = 0.53). This result was predicted from the theoretical grounds of the BOLD response and is in agreement with several previous works [Toronov, V.A.W., Choi, J.H., Wolf, M., Michalos, A., Gratton, E., Hueber, D., 2001. "Investigation of human brain hemodynamics by simultaneous near-infrared spectroscopy and functional magnetic resonance imaging." Med.

"The roles of changes in deoxyhemoglobin concentration and regional cerebral blood volume in the fMRI BOLD signal" Neuroimage 19 (4) 1521-1531]. These data have also allowed us to examine more detailed measurement models of the fMRI signal and comment on the roles of the oxygen saturation and blood volume contributions to the BOLD response. In addition, we found high correlation between the NIRS measured total hemoglobin and ASL measured cerebral blood flow (R = 0.91; P {$<$} 10(-10)) and oxy-hemoglobin with flow (R = 0.83; P {$<$} 10(-05)) as predicted by the biophysical models. Finally, we note a significant amount of cross-modality, correlated, inter-subject variability in amplitude change and time-to-peak of the hemodynamic response. The observed co-variance in these parameters between subjects is in agreement with hemodynamic models and provides further support that fMRI and NIRS have similar vascular sensitivity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We investigated cardiovascular responses to an orthostatic challenge in trained spinal cord-injured (SCI) individuals compared to able-bodied (AB) individuals.
METHODS: A total of 23 subjects participated, divided into three groups: seven were trained as spinal cord-injured (Tr-SCI) individuals, seven were able-bodied individuals trained as runners (Tr-AB), and nine were untrained able-bodied individuals (UnTr-AB). We measured the cardiovascular autonomic responses in all three groups during each 5-min head-up tilt (HUT) of 0\textdegree, 40\textdegree, and 80\textdegree. Stroke volume (SV), heart rate (HR), and cardiac output (Qc) as cardiovascular responses were measured by impedance cardiography. Changes in deoxyhemoglobin ({$\increment$}[HHb]) and total hemoglobin ({$\increment$}[Hbtot]) concentrations of the right medial gastrocnemius muscle were measured using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).
RESULTS: As the HUT increased from 0\textdegree{} to 80\textdegree, Tr-SCI group showed less change in SV at all HUT levels even if HR increased significantly. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) also did not significantly increase as tilting increased from 0\textdegree{} to 80\textdegree. Regarding peripheral vascular responses, the alterations of {$\increment$}[Hbtot] from 0\textdegree{} to 80\textdegree{} were less in Tr-SCI group compared to AB individuals.
CONCLUSION: There is a specific mechanism whereby blood pressure is maintained during a HUT in Tr-SCI group with the elicitation of peripheral vasoconstriction and the atrophy of the vascular vessels in paraplegic lower limbs, which would be associated with less change in SV in response to an orthostatic challenge.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to investigate age-related changes of microvascular functions using wavelet analysis of blood flow oscillations (BFO), and to develop a new quantification method to present wavelet coefficients for studying the contribution of each blood flow control mechanism to the skin vasodilatory response. 20 older people between 65 and 85~years of age were recruited into the study. The heater temperature at the sacral skin was raised to 42~\textdegree{}C in 2~min and maintained at that temperature for the duration of the 50~minute heating period to induce a biphasic vasodilatory response: axon reflex mediated and nitric oxide mediated vasodilation. Wavelet-based spectrum analysis was used to calculate sacral skin blood flow and frequency bands including metabolic (0.008\textendash{}0.02~Hz), neurogenic (0.02\textendash{}0.05~Hz), myogenic (0.05\textendash{}0.15~Hz), respiratory (0.15\textendash{}0.4~Hz), and cardiac (0.4\textendash{}2.0~Hz) frequencies. Biphasic Thermal Index is defined as ratios of first peak, nadir, and second peak to baseline blood flow. The results showed that older people have a biphasic blood flow response with lower vasodilatory function. Increased age is associated with an increase in baseline blood flow and a decrease of skin vasodilatory function (p{$<$}0.05). Biphasic Thermal Index is (5.5, 4.5, 10.1) for the 65\textendash{}75~years group and is (3.7, 3.2, 6.7) for the 75\textendash{}85~years group. During local heating, the metabolic frequency appears to become the most dominant frequency in power during the second peak, and the power of neurogenic frequency does not seem to significantly increase during the axon reflex mediated vasodilation. Wavelet coefficients averaged during the one-minute period are able to characterize time-series changes of frequencies. This study has shown the feasibility of using wavelet-based spectrum analysis of skin blood flow oscillations to assess skin microvascular function for detection of the specific conditions which constitute the highest risk factors for pressure ulcers among older people. Aging is associated with a decrease of skin blood flow function, which results in increased risk for ischemic damage and pressure ulcers.},

Previous models and empirical investigations of sequence learning in humans and non-human animals have implicated cortico-basal ganglia-cerebellar circuitry as well as other structures. To systematically examine the functional neuroanatomy of sequence learning in humans, we conducted a series of neuroanatomical meta-analyses. We focused on the serial reaction time (SRT) task. This task, which is the most widely used paradigm for probing sequence learning in humans, allows for the rigorous control of visual, motor, and other factors. Controlling for these factors (in sequence-random block contrasts), sequence learning yielded consistent activation only in the basal ganglia, across the striatum (anterior/mid caudate nucleus and putamen) and the globus pallidus. In contrast, when visual, motor, and other factors were not controlled for (in a global analysis with all sequence-baseline contrasts, not just sequence-random contrasts), premotor cortical and cerebellar activation were additionally observed. The study provides solid evidence that, at least as tested with the visuo-motor SRT task, sequence learning in humans relies on the basal ganglia, whereas cerebellar and premotor regions appear to contribute to aspects of the task not related to sequence learning itself. The findings have both basic research and translational implications.},

Numerous studies have investigated the neural underpinnings of passive and active deviance and target detection in the well-known auditory oddball paradigm by means of event-related potentials (ERPs) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The present auditory oddball study investigates the spatio-temporal dynamics of passive versus active deviance and target detection by analyzing amplitude modulations of early and late ERPs while at the same time exploring the neural sources underling this modulation with standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA)
.

Methods
A 64-channel EEG was recorded from twelve healthy right-handed participants while listening to `standards' and `deviants' (500 vs. 1000~Hz pure tones) during a passive (block 1) and an active (block 2) listening condition. During passive listening, participants had to simply listen to the tones. During active listening they had to attend and press a key in response to the deviant tones.

Results
Passive and active listening elicited an N1 component, a mismatch negativity (MMN) as difference potential (whose amplitudes were temporally overlapping with the N1) and a P3 component. N1/MMN and P3 amplitudes were significantly more pronounced for deviants as compared to standards during both listening conditions. Active listening augmented P3 modulation to deviants significantly compared to passive listening, whereas deviance detection as indexed by N1/MMN modulation was unaffected by the task. During passive listening, sLORETA contrasts (deviants\,{$>$}\,standards) revealed significant activations in the right superior temporal gyrus (STG) and the lingual gyri bilaterally (N1/MMN) as well as in the left and right insulae (P3). During active listening, significant activations were found for the N1/MMN in the right inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and for the P3 in multiple cortical regions (e.g., precuneus).

Discussion
The results provide evidence for the hypothesis that passive as well as active deviance and target detection elicit cortical activations in spatially distributed brain regions and neural networks including the ventral attention network (VAN), dorsal attention network (DAN) and salience network (SN). Based on the temporal activation of the neural sources underlying ERP modulations, a neurophysiological model of passive and active deviance and target detection is proposed which can be tested in future studies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study assesses the utility of a hybrid optical instrument for noninvasive transcranial monitoring in the neurointensive care unit. The instrument is based on diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) for measurement of cerebral blood flow (CBF), and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) for measurement of oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin concentration. DCS/NIRS measurements of CBF and oxygenation from frontal lobes are compared with concurrent xenon-enhanced computed tomography (XeCT) in patients during induced blood pressure changes and carbon dioxide arterial partial pressure variation.
METHODS: Seven neurocritical care patients were included in the study. Relative CBF measured by DCS (rCBF(DCS)), and changes in oxy-hemoglobin (DeltaHbO(2)), deoxy-hemoglobin (DeltaHb), and total hemoglobin concentration (DeltaTHC), measured by NIRS, were continuously monitored throughout XeCT during a baseline scan and a scan after intervention. CBF from XeCT regions-of-interest (ROIs) under the optical probes were used to calculate relative XeCT CBF (rCBF(XeCT)) and were then compared to rCBF(DCS). Spearman's rank coefficients were employed to test for associations between rCBF(DCS) and rCBF(XeCT), as well as between rCBF from both modalities and NIRS parameters.
RESULTS: rCBF(DCS) and rCBF(XeCT) showed good correlation (r (s) = 0.73, P = 0.010) across the patient cohort. Moderate correlations between rCBF(DCS) and DeltaHbO(2)/DeltaTHC were also observed. Both NIRS and DCS distinguished the effects of xenon inhalation on CBF, which varied among the patients.
CONCLUSIONS: DCS measurements of CBF and NIRS measurements of tissue blood oxygenation were successfully obtained in neurocritical care patients. The potential for DCS to provide continuous, noninvasive bedside monitoring for the purpose of CBF management and individualized care is demonstrated.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Head-of-bed manipulation is commonly performed in the neurocritical care unit to optimize cerebral blood flow (CBF), but its effects on CBF are rarely measured. This pilot study employs a novel, non-invasive instrument combining two techniques, diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) for measurement of CBF and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) for measurement of cerebral oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin concentrations, to monitor patients during head-of-bed lowering.
METHODS: Ten brain-injured patients and ten control subjects were monitored continuously with DCS and NIRS while the head-of-bed was positioned first at 30\textdegree{} and then at 0\textdegree. Relative CBF (rCBF) and concurrent changes in oxy- ({$\Delta$}HbO2), deoxy- ({$\Delta$}Hb), and total-hemoglobin concentrations ({$\Delta$}THC) from left/right frontal cortices were monitored for 5 min at each position. Patient and control response differences were assessed.
RESULTS: rCBF, {$\Delta$}HbO2, and {$\Delta$}THC responses to head lowering differed significantly between brain-injured patients and healthy controls (P {$<$} 0.02). For patients, rCBF changes were heterogeneous, with no net change observed in the group average (0.3 {$\pm$} 28.2 \%, P = 0.938). rCBF increased in controls (18.6 {$\pm$} 9.4 \%, P {$<$} 0.001). {$\Delta$}HbO2, {$\Delta$}Hb, and {$\Delta$}THC increased with head lowering in both groups, but to a larger degree in brain-injured patients. rCBF correlated moderately with changes in cerebral perfusion pressure (R = 0.40, P {$<$} 0.001), but not intracranial pressure.
CONCLUSION: DCS/NIRS detected differences in CBF and oxygenation responses of brain-injured patients versus controls during head-of-bed manipulation. This pilot study supports the feasibility of continuous bedside measurement of cerebrovascular hemodynamics with DCS/NIRS and provides the rationale for further investigation in larger cohorts.},

  abstract = {This study investigated the interaction between two executive function processes, inhibition and updating, through analyses of behavioral, neurophysiological, and effective connectivity metrics. Although, many studies have focused on behavioral effects of executive function processes individually, few studies have examined the dynamic causal interactions between these two functions. A total of twenty participants from a local university performed a dual task combing flanker and n-back experimental paradigms, and completed the Operation Span Task designed to measure working memory capacity. We found that both behavioral (accuracy and reaction time) and neurophysiological (P300 amplitude and alpha band power) metrics on the inhibition task (i.e., flanker task) were influenced by the updating load (n-back level) and modulated by working memory capacity. Using independent component analysis, source localization (DIPFIT), and Granger Causality analysis of the EEG time-series data, the present study demonstrated that manipulation of cognitive demand in a dual executive function task influenced the causal neural network. We compared connectivity across three updating loads (n-back levels) and found that experimental manipulation of working memory load enhanced causal connectivity of a large-scale neurocognitive network. This network contains the prefrontal and parietal cortices, which are associated with inhibition and updating executive function processes. This study has potential applications in human performance modeling and assessment of mental workload, such as the design of training materials and interfaces for those performing complex multitasking under stress.},

This paper attempts to identify a possible link between changes in brain blood flow and neuronal activity during microgravity. Middle cerebral artery flow velocity (MCAv) was measured using Doppler ultrasound. Brain cortical activity (i.e., cortical current density) was measured using electroencephalography. Finger blood pressure was recorded and exported to generate beat-by-beat systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO), and cerebrovascular conductance index (CVCi). Seventeen participants were evaluated under normal gravity conditions and microgravity conditions, during 15 bouts of 22-s intervals of weightlessness during a parabolic flight. Although MAP decreased and CO increased, MCAv remained unchanged in the microgravity condition. CVCi as the quotient of MCAv and MAP increased in microgravity. Cortical current density showed a global decrease. Our data support earlier data reporting a decrease in the amplitude of event-related potentials recorded during microgravity. However, the general decrease in neural excitability in microgravity seems not to be dependent on hemodynamic changes.},

The present study examined the effects of postural changes on cerebral oxygenation as reflected in SRS-NIRS findings. Cerebral oxyhaemoglobin (O2Hb), deoxyhaemoglobin (HHb), and the TOI were recorded from both sides of the forehead in five healthy male subjects (age range, 28-40 years) during 90 degrees head-up tilt (HUT) and -6 degrees head-down tilt (HDT). Three series of measurements were carried out on separate days. O2Hb was decreased during HUT. TOI was significantly lower in HUT than in the supine position (SUP). There was no significant change in TOI during HDT. A significant session effect was observed in the left forehead TOI during SUP, but not in the right. SRS-NIRS measurements confirmed sub-clinical alterations of cortical oxygenation during HUT. NIRS data from the left side of the forehead, which may vary with cognitive or emotional activation, were more variable than those from the right side.},

  abstract = {KEY POINTS: Astronauts have recently been discovered to have impaired vision, with a presentation that resembles syndromes of elevated intracranial pressure on Earth. Gravity has a profound effect on fluid distribution and pressure within the human circulation. In contrast to prevailing theory, we observed that microgravity reduces central venous and intracranial pressure. This being said, intracranial pressure is not reduced to the levels observed in the 90~deg seated upright posture on Earth. Thus, over 24~h in zero gravity, pressure in the brain is slightly above that observed on Earth, which may explain remodelling of the eye in astronauts.
ABSTRACT: Astronauts have recently been discovered to have impaired vision, with a presentation that resembles syndromes of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). This syndrome is considered the most mission-critical medical problem identified in the past decade of manned spaceflight. We recruited five men and three women who had an Ommaya reservoir inserted for the delivery of prophylactic CNS chemotherapy, but were free of their malignant disease for at least 1~year. ICP was assessed by placing a fluid-filled 25 gauge butterfly needle into the Ommaya reservoir. Subjects were studied in the upright and supine position, during acute zero gravity (parabolic flight) and prolonged simulated microgravity (6~deg head-down tilt bedrest). ICP was lower when seated in the 90~deg upright posture compared to lying supine (seated, 4~{$\pm{}~$}1 vs. supine, 15~{$\pm{}~$}2~mmHg). Whilst lying in the supine posture, central venous pressure (supine, 7~{$\pm{}~$}3 vs. microgravity, 4~{$\pm{}~$}2~mmHg) and ICP (supine, 17~{$\pm{}~$}2 vs. microgravity, 13~{$\pm{}~$}2~mmHg) were reduced in acute zero gravity, although not to the levels observed in the 90~deg seated upright posture on Earth. Prolonged periods of simulated microgravity did not cause progressive elevations in ICP (supine, 15~{$\pm{}~$}2~vs. 24~h head-down tilt, 15~{$\pm{}~$}4~mmHg). Complete removal of gravity does not pathologically elevate ICP but does prevent the normal lowering of ICP when upright. These findings suggest the human brain is protected by the daily circadian cycles in regional ICPs, without which pathology may occur.},

and deoxygenated (deoxyHb) haemoglobin molecules in the blood, a method commonly
used to assess cerebral activity. Over the last decade, functional near-infrared spectroscopy
(fNIRS) has widely extended its applications due to its capacity to quantify oxygenation in
blood and organic tissue in a continuous and non invasive manner (Chance \& Leigh, 1977;
Villringer \& Chance, 1997). This technique is an effective, albeit `indirect', optical
neuroimaging method that monitors hemodynamic response to brain activation, on the
basis that neural activation and vascular response are tightly coupled, so termed
`neurovascular coupling'. Different studies show that neural activity and hemodynamic
response maintain a lineal relationship (Arthurs \& Boniface, 2003; Logothetis et al., 2001),
suggesting that these changes in hemodynamic response could provide a good marker for
assessing neural activity. In neuroscience, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is
used to measure cerebral functions through different chromophore mobilization
(oxygenated haemoglobin, deoxygenated haemoglobin and cytochrome c-oxidase) and their
timing with concrete events...},

Whether auditory-motor integration for voice control can benefit from working memory training, however, remains unclear. The present event-related potential (ERP) study examined the impact of working memory training on the auditory-motor processing of vocal pitch. Trained participants underwent adaptive working memory training using a digit span backwards paradigm, while control participants did not receive any training. Before and after training, both trained and control participants were exposed to frequency-altered auditory feedback while producing vocalizations. After training, trained participants exhibited significantly decreased N1 amplitudes and increased P2 amplitudes in response to pitch errors in voice auditory feedback. In addition, there was a significant positive correlation between the degree of improvement in working memory capacity and the post-pre difference in P2 amplitudes. Training-related changes in the vocal compensation, however, were not observed. There was no systematic change in either vocal or cortical responses for control participants. These findings provide evidence that working memory training impacts the cortical processing of feedback errors in vocal pitch regulation. This enhanced cortical processing may be the result of increased neural efficiency in the detection of pitch errors between the intended and actual feedback.},

Eleven Sprague\textendash{}Dawley rats were studied: 7 rats underwent surface pressure with local heating ({$\Delta$}t = 10 \textdegree{}C) and 4 rats underwent pressure without heating. A pressure of 700 mmHg was applied to the right trochanter area of rats for 3 h. Skin blood flow was measured using laser Doppler flowmetry. The loading period was divided into nonoverlapping 30 min epochs. For each epoch, multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MDFA) was utilized to compute DFA coefficients and complexity of endothelia related metabolic, neurogenic, and myogenic frequencies of BFO. The results showed that under surface pressure, local heating led to a significant decrease in DFA coefficients of myogenic frequency during the initial epoch of loading period, a sustained decrease in complexity of myogenic frequency, and a significantly higher degree of complexity of metabolic frequency during the later phase of loading period. Surrogate tests showed that the reduction in complexity of myogenic frequency was associated with a loss of nonlinearity whereas increased complexity of metabolic frequency was associated with enhanced nonlinearity. Our results indicate that increased metabolic activity and decreased myogenic response due to local heating manifest themselves not only in magnitudes of metabolic and myogenic frequencies but also in their structural complexity. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using complexity analysis of BFO to monitor the ischemic status of weight-bearing skin and risk of pressure ulcers.},

Furthermore, there is a lack of neurophysiological evidence about WM function in patients with BPD. The goal of this study was to examine WM function in patients with BPD by using event-related potentials (ERPs). An additional goal was to explore whether characteristics of BPD (i.e., impulsiveness and emotional instability) are associated with WM impairment. A modified version of the N-back task (0- and 2-back) was used to measure WM. ERPs were recorded in 22 BPD patients and 21 age-, handedness-, and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) while they performed the WM task. The results revealed that there were no significant group differences for behavioral variables (reaction time and accuracy rate) or for latencies and amplitudes of P1 and N1 (all p {$>$} 0.05). BPD patients had lower P3 amplitudes and longer N2 latencies than HC, independent of WM load (low load: 0-back; high load: 2-back). Impulsiveness was not correlated with N2 latency or P3 amplitude, and no correlations were found between N2 latency or P3 amplitude and affect intensity scores in any WM load (all p {$>$} 0.05). In conclusion, the lower P3 amplitudes and longer N2 latencies in BPD patients suggested that they might have some dysfunction of neural activities in sub-processing in WM, while impulsiveness and negative affect might not have a close relationship with these deficits.},

  abstract = {Background
The Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) is a useful cognitive test in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), assessing sustained attention and information processing speed. However, the neural underpinnings of performance in the test are controversial. We aimed to study the neural basis of PASAT performance by using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a series of 242 patients with MS.

Methods
PASAT (3-s) was administered together with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. Global brain volumes and total T2-weighted lesion volumes were estimated. Voxel-based morphometry and lesion symptom mapping analyses were performed.

Results
Mean PASAT score was 42.98\,{$\pm$}\,10.44; results indicated impairment in 75 cases (31.0\%). PASAT score was correlated with several clusters involving the following regions: bilateral precuneus and posterior cingulate, bilateral caudate and putamen, and bilateral cerebellum. Voxel-based lesion symptom mapping showed no significant clusters. Region of interest\textendash{}based analysis restricted to white matter regions revealed a correlation with the left cingulum, corpus callosum, bilateral corticospinal tracts, and right arcuate fasciculus. Correlations between PASAT scores and global volumes were weak.

Conclusion
PASAT score was associated with regional volumes of the posterior cingulate/precuneus and several subcortical structures, specifically the caudate, putamen, and cerebellum. This emphasises the role of both cortical and subcortical structures in cognitive functioning and information processing speed in patients with MS.

  abstract = {Brain near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is an emerging neurophysiological tool that combines straightforward activity localization with cost-economy, portability and patient compatibility. NIRS is proving its empirical utility across specific cognitive and emotional paradigms. However, a potential limitation is that it is not only sensitive to haemodynamic changes taking place in the cortex, and task-related cardiovascular responses expressed in the perfusion of extracranial layers may be confounding. Existing literature reports correlations between brain NIRS and systemic blood pressure, yet it falls short of establishing whether in normal participants the blood pressure changes encountered in experimental settings can have confounding effects. Here, we tested this hypothesis by performing two experimental manipulations while recording from superficial occipital cortex, encompassing striate and extrastriate regions. Visual stimulation with reversing chequerboards evoked cortical haemodynamic responses. Simultaneously and independently, transient systemic blood pressure changes were generated through rapid arm-raising. Shallow-penetration NIRS recordings, probing only extra-cerebral tissues, highlighted close haemodynamic coupling with blood pressure. A different coupling pattern was observed in deep-penetration recordings directed at haemodynamic signals from visual cortex. In absence of blood-pressure changes, NIRS signals tracked differences in visual stimulus duration. However when blood pressure was actively manipulated, this effect was absent and replaced by a very large pressure-related response. Our observations demonstrate that blood pressure fluctuations can exert confounding effects on brain NIRS, through expression in extracranial tissues and within the brain itself. We highlight the necessity for continuous blood pressure monitoring alongside brain NIRS, and for further research on methods to correct for physiological confounds.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive, real-time bedside modality sensitive to changes in cerebral perfusion and oxygenation and is highly sensitive to physiological oscillations at different frequencies. However, the clinical feasibility of NIRS remains limited, partly due to concerns regarding NIRS signal quantification, which relies on mostly arbitrary assumptions on hemoglobin concentrations and tissue layers. In this pilot study comparing stroke patients to healthy controls, we explored the utility of the interhemispheric correlation coefficient (IHCC) during physiological oscillations in detecting asymmetry in hemispheric microvascular hemodynamics.
METHODS: Using bi-hemispheric continuous-wave NIRS, 12 patients with hemispheric strokes and 9 controls were measured prospectively. NIRS signal was band-pass filtered to isolate cardiac (0.7-3 Hz) and respiratory (0.15-0.7 Hz) oscillations. IHCCs were calculated in both oscillation frequency bands. Using Fisher's Z-transform for non-Gaussian distributions, the IHCC during cardiac and respiratory oscillations were compared between both groups.
RESULTS: Nine patients and nine controls had data of sufficient quality to be included in the analysis. The IHCCs during cardiac and respiratory oscillations were significantly different between patients versus controls (cardiac 0.79 +/- 0.18 vs. 0.94 +/- 0.07, P = 0.025; respiratory 0.24 +/- 0.28 vs. 0.59 +/- 0.3; P = 0.016).
CONCLUSIONS: Computing the IHCC during physiological cardiac and respiratory oscillations may be a new NIRS analysis technique to quantify asymmetric microvascular hemodynamics in stroke patients in the neurocritical care unit. It allows each subject to serve as their own control obviating the need for arbitrary assumptions on absolute hemoglobin concentration. Future clinical applications may include rapid identification of patients with ischemic brain injury in the pre-hospital setting. This promising new analysis technique warrants further validation.},

The effects of different spectral estimation procedures were compared, using simulated and clinical data. It was shown that data detrending, as used in many studies, can lead to an artifactual peak in the very low-frequency region of estimated power spectra, indicating that the peak cannot be taken as evidence of physiological oscillations. A quantitative, reliable method is described that can be used to assess very low-frequency oscillations. Using the method, very low-frequency oscillations were found in ten out of 17 healthy adults measured with transcranial Doppler (average frequency, 0.021 +/- 0.007 Hz, mean +/- SD), confirming earlier findings based on visual inspection of data.},

  abstract = {Inhibitory control is a core executive function (EF) skill, thought to involve cognitive 'interference suppression' and motor 'response inhibition' sub-processes. A few studies have shown that early bilingualism shapes interference suppression but not response inhibition skills, however current behavioral measures do not fully allow us to disentangle these subcomponents. Lateralized Readiness Potentials (LRPs) are centroparietal event-related potentials (ERPs) that track motor response-preparations between stimulus-presentation and behavioral responses. We examine LRPs elicited during successful inhibitory control on a nonverbal Stroop task, in 6-8 year-old bilingual (n = 44) and monolingual (n = 48) children from comparable socio-economic backgrounds. Relative to monolinguals, bilinguals showed longer and stronger incorrect-response preparations, and a more mature pattern of correct-response preparation (shorter peak-latencies), underlying correct responses on Stroop-interference trials. Neural markers of response-inhibition were comparable between groups and no behavioral differences were found between-groups on the Stroop task. Results suggest group differences in underlying mechanisms of centroparietal motor-response preparation mechanisms in this age group, contrary to what has been shown using behavioral tasks previously. We discuss neural results in the context of speed-accuracy trade-offs. This is the first study to examine neural markers of motor-responses in bilingual children.},

  abstract = {Response inhibition deficits are widely believed to be at the core of Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Several studies have examined neural architectural correlates of ADHD, but research directly examining structural correlates of response inhibition is lacking. Here we examine the relationship between response inhibition as measured by a Go/No Go task, and cortical surface area and thickness of the caudal inferior frontal gyrus (cIFG), a region implicated in functional imaging studies of response inhibition, in a sample of 114 young adults with and without ADHD diagnosed initially during childhood. We used multiple linear regression models to test the hypothesis that Go/No Go performance would be associated with cIFG surface area or thickness. Results showed that poorer Go/No Go performance was associated with thicker cIFG cortex, and this effect was not mediated by ADHD status or history of substance use. However, independent of Go/No Go performance, persistence of ADHD symptoms and more frequent cannabis use were associated with thinner cIFG. Go/No Go performance was not associated with cortical surface area. The association between poor inhibitory functioning and thicker cIFG suggests that maturation of this region may differ in low performing participants. An independent association of persistent ADHD symptoms and frequent cannabis use with thinner cIFG cortex suggests that distinct neural mechanisms within this region may play a role in inhibitory function, broader ADHD symptomatology, and cannabis use. These results contribute to Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) by revealing novel associations between neural architectural phenotypes and basic neurobehavioral processes measured dimensionally.},

  abstract = {Background: The paced auditory serial addition test (PASAT) was primarily developed to assess the effects of traumatic brain injury
on cognitive functioning. Working memory (WM) is one of the most important aspects of cognitive function, and WM impairment
is one of the clinically remarkable signs of aphasia. To develop the Persian version of PASAT, an initial version was used in individuals
with aphasia (IWA).
, 
Methods: In this study, 25 individuals with aphasia (29-60 years) and 85 controls (18-60 years) were included. PASAT was presented
in the form of recorded 61 single-digit numbers (1 to 9). The participants repeatedly added the 2 recent digits. The psychometric
properties of PASAT including convergent validity (using the digit memory span tasks), divergent validity (using results in the control
group and IWA group), and face validity were investigated. Test-retest reliability was considered as well.
, 
Results: The relationship between the PASAT and digit memory span tests was moderate to strong in the control group (forward
digit memory span test: r= 0.52, p{$<$} 0.0001; backward digit memory span test: r = 0.48, p{$<$} 0.0001). A strong relationship was found in
IWA (forward digit memory span test: r= 0.72, p{$<$} 0.0001; backward digit memory span test: r= 0.53, p= 0.006). Also, strong testretest
reliability (intraclass correlation= 0.95, p{$<$} 0.0001) was observed.
, 
Conclusion: According to our results, the PASAT is a valid and reliable test to assess working memory, particularly in IWA. It
could be used as a feasible tool for clinical and research applications.},

Also (3) influences of functional stimulation and hypercapnia on power and phase shifts were investigated. The results show that\textemdash{}in line with the literature\textemdash{}low frequency oscillations (LFO) centred around 0.1 s-1 and even slower oscillations at about 0.04 s-1 (very low frequency, VLFO) can be distinguished. Their respective power differs between oxy-Hb, deoxy-Hb, and Cyt-ox. Either frequency (LFO and VLFO) is altered in magnitude by functional stimulation of the cortical area examined. Also we find a change of the phase shift between the vascular parameters (oxy-Hb, tot-Hb) and the metabolic parameter (Cyt-ox) evoked by the stimulation. It is shown that hypercapnia attenuates the LFO in oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb. Conclusions: (1) spontaneous vascular and metabolic LFO and VLFO can be reproducibly detected by NIRS in the human adult. (2) Their spectral characteristics and their response to hypercapnia are in line with those described in exposed cortex (for review see (Hudetz et al., 1998)) and correspond to findings with transcranial doppler sonography (TCD) (Diehl et al., 1995) and fMRI (Biswal et al., 1997). (3) The magnitude of and phase relation between NIRS-parameters at the LFO may allow for a local noninvasive assessment of autoregulatory mechanisms in the adult brain.},

We conducted a quantitative meta-analysis of 668 sets of activation coordinates in Talairach space reported in 24 primary studies of n-back task variants manipulating process (location vs. identity monitoring) and content (verbal or nonverbal) of working memory. We found the following cortical regions were activated robustly (voxelwise false discovery rate = 1\%): lateral premotor cortex; dorsal cingulate and medial premotor cortex; dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex; frontal poles; and medial and lateral posterior parietal cortex. Subsidiary meta-analyses based on appropriate subsets of the primary data demonstrated broadly similar activation patterns for identity monitoring of verbal stimuli and both location and identity monitoring of nonverbal stimuli. There was also some evidence for distinct frontoparietal activation patterns in response to different task variants. The functional specializations of each of the major cortical components in the generic large-scale frontoparietal system are discussed. We conclude that quantitative meta-analysis can be a powerful tool for combining results of multiple primary studies reported in Talairach space. Here, it provides evidence both for broadly consistent activation of frontal and parietal cortical regions by various versions of the n-back working memory paradigm, and for process- and content-specific frontoparietal activation by working memory.},

To this goal, we have reviewed 110 fNIRS articles published in 2016 in the field of cognitive neuroscience, and performed a simulation analysis with synthetic fNIRS data, to optimize the signal filtering step before applying the GLM method for statistical inference. Our results highlight the fact that many papers lack important information, and there is a large variability in the filtering methods used. Our simulations demonstrated that the optimal approach to remove noise and recover the hemodynamic response from fNIRS data in a GLM framework is to use a 1000th order band-pass Finite Impulse Response filter. Based on these results, we give preliminary recommendations as to the first step towards improving the analysis of fNIRS data and dissemination of the results.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The randomized clinical trial, SafeBoosC II, examined the effect of monitoring of cerebral oxygenation by near-infrared spectroscopy combined with a guideline on treatment when cerebral oxygenation was out of the target range. Data on cerebral oxygenation was collected in both the intervention and the control group. The primary outcome was the reduction in the burden of cerebral hypo- and hyperoxia between the two groups. In this study we describe the associations between the burden of cerebral hypo- and hyperoxia, regardless of allocation to intervention or control group, and the biomarkers of brain injury from birth till term equivalent age that was collected as secondary and explorative outcomes in the SafeBoosC II trial.
METHODS: Cerebral oxygenation was continuously monitored during the first 72h of life in 166 extremely preterm infants. Cranial ultrasound was performed at day 1,4,7,14, and 35 and at term. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded at 64h. Blood-samples taken at 6 and 64 hours were analysed for the brain injury biomarkers; S100beta, brain-fatty-acid-binding-protein, and neuroketal. All analyses were conducted post hoc.
RESULTS: Significantly more infants with a cerebral burden of hypoxia within the 4th quartile versus infants within quartile 1-3 were diagnosed with severe intracranial haemorrhage (11/39 versus 11/117, p = 0.003), had low burst rate on EEG (12/28 versus 21/103, p = 0.015), or died (14/41 versus 18/123, p = 0.006), whereas none of these events were significantly associated with cerebral hyperoxia. The blood biomarkers were not significantly associated with the burden of cerebral hypo- or hyperoxia.
CONCLUSIONS: The explorative analysis showed that early burden of cerebral hypoxia, but not hyperoxia was significantly associated with low brain electrical activity and severe intracranial haemorrhage while none of the three blood biomarkers were associated with the burden of either cerebral hypo- or hyperoxia.},

  abstract = {Measurement of muscle oxidative metabolism is of interest for monitoring the training status in athletes and the rehabilitation process in patients. Time domain near infrared spectroscopy (TD NIRS) is an optical technique that allows the non-invasive measurement of the hemodynamic parameters in muscular tissue: concentrations of oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin, total hemoglobin content, and tissue oxygen saturation. In this paper, we present a novel TD NIRS medical device for muscle oxidative metabolism. A custom-printed 3D probe, able to host optical elements for signal acquisition from muscle, was develop for TD NIRS in vivo measurements. The system was widely characterized on solid phantoms and during in vivo protocols on healthy subjects. In particular, we tested the in vivo repeatability of the measurements to quantify the error that we can have by repositioning the probe. Furthermore, we considered a series of acquisitions on different muscles that were not yet previously performed with this custom probe: a venous-arterial cuff occlusion of the arm muscle, a cycling exercise, and an isometric contraction of the vastus lateralis.},

  abstract = {Depression has been shown to be related to a variety of aberrant brain functions and structures. Particularly the investigation of alterations in functional connectivity (FC) in major depressive disorder (MDD) has been a promising endeavor, since a better understanding of pathological brain networks may foster our understanding of the disease. However, the underling mechanisms of aberrant FC in MDD are largely unclear. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) we investigated FC in the cortical parts of the default mode network (DMN) during resting-state in patients with current MDD. Additionally, we used qualitative and quantitative measures of psychological processes (e.g., state/trait rumination, mind-wandering) to investigate their contribution to differences in FC between depressed and non-depressed subjects. Our results indicate that 40\% of the patients report spontaneous rumination during resting-state. Depressed subjects showed reduced FC in parts of the DMN compared to healthy controls. This finding was linked to the process of state/trait rumination. While rumination was negatively correlated with FC in the cortical parts of the DMN, mind-wandering showed positive associations.},

  abstract = {Objective
To assess affective event-related brain potentials (ERPs) using visual pictures that were highly distinct on arousal level/valence category ratings and a response task.

Methods
Images from the International Affective Pictures System (IAPS) were selected to obtain distinct affective arousal (low, high) and valence (negative, positive) rating levels. The pictures were used as target stimuli in an oddball paradigm, with a visual pattern as the standard stimulus. Participants were instructed to press a button whenever a picture occurred and to ignore the standard. Task performance and response time did not differ across conditions.

Results
High-arousal compared to low-arousal stimuli produced larger amplitudes for the N2, P3, early slow wave, and late slow wave components. Valence amplitude effects were weak overall and originated primarily from the later waveform components and interactions with electrode position. Gender differences were negligible.

Conclusion
The findings suggest that arousal level is the primary determinant of affective oddball processing, and valence minimally influences ERP amplitude.

Significance
Affective processing engages selective attentional mechanisms that are primarily sensitive to the arousal properties of emotional stimuli. The application and nature of task demands are important considerations for interpreting these effects.},

To examine whether age-related changes in brain activity varied with working memory performance efficiency, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) from young and older healthy adults during performance on an n-back task with two loads (0- and 1-back) and two versions (identity and integrated). Young adults showed a typical P3 amplitude pattern with a parietal-maximum. Compared to young adults, the P3 amplitude of older adults was characterized by frontal hyperactivity coupled with posterior hypoactivity. Moreover, P3 amplitude in young and older adults varied with working memory performance efficiency. Among young adults, more efficient performance correlated with a larger P3 amplitude at parietal sites. In contrast, a higher P3 amplitude at midline electrode sites in older adults correlated with less efficient performance. Particularly, the enhanced frontal midline EEG activity in older adults during working memory performance seems to reflect inefficient use of neural resources due to frontal lobe dysfunction.},

  abstract = {Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is used to measure cerebral activity because it is simple and portable. However, scalp-hemodynamics often contaminates fNIRS signals, leading to detection of cortical activity in regions that are actually inactive. Methods for removing these artifacts using standard source\textendash{}detector distance channels (Long-channel) tend to over-estimate the artifacts, while methods using additional short source\textendash{}detector distance channels (Short-channel) require numerous probes to cover broad cortical areas, which leads to a high cost and prolonged experimental time. Here, we propose a new method that effectively combines the existing techniques, preserving the accuracy of estimating cerebral activity and avoiding the disadvantages inherent when applying the techniques individually. Our new method accomplishes this by estimating a global scalp-hemodynamic component from a small number of Short-channels, and removing its influence from the Long-channels using a general linear model (GLM). To demonstrate the feasibility of this method, we collected fNIRS and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements during a motor task. First, we measured changes in oxygenated hemoglobin concentration ({$\increment$}Oxy-Hb) from 18 Short-channels placed over motor-related areas, and confirmed that the majority of scalp-hemodynamics was globally consistent and could be estimated from as few as four Short-channels using principal component analysis. We then measured {$\increment$}Oxy-Hb from 4 Short- and 43 Long-channels. The GLM identified cerebral activity comparable to that measured separately by fMRI, even when scalp-hemodynamics exhibited substantial task-related modulation. These results suggest that combining measurements from four Short-channels with a GLM provides robust estimation of cerebral activity at a low cost.},

Our findings show that while several scoring methods have been reported in literature, none of the reviewed methods enables us to fully assess the Stroop effect.

We claim for an alternative scoring method which takes into consideration both speed and accuracy of the response.

  abstract = {According to theoretical accounts, both, N-back and complex span tasks mainly require working memory (WM) processing. In contrast, simple span tasks conceptually mainly require WM storage. Thus, conceptually, an N-back task and a complex span task share more commonalities as compared to a simple span task. In the current study, we compared an N-back task, a complex operation span task (Ospan), and a simple digit span task (Dspan) by means of typical WM load-related measures of the Electroencephalogram (EEG) like the parietal alpha and beta frequency band power, the frontal theta frequency band power, and the P300 amplitude, to examine whether these tasks would show commonalities or differences in WM processing-load. We expected that increasing WM-load would generally lead to a decreased alpha and beta frequency band power, an increased theta frequency band power, and a decreased P300 amplitude. Yet, based on the conceptual considerations, we hypothesized that the outcomes of these measures would be more comparable between the N-back and the Ospan as compared to the Dspan. Our hypotheses were partly confirmed. The N-back and the Ospan showed timely more prolonged alpha frequency band power effects as compared to the Dspan. This might indicate higher demands on WM processing in the former two tasks. The theta frequency band power and the P300 amplitude were most pronounced in the N-back task as compared to both span tasks. This might indicate specific demands on cognitive control in the N-back task. Additionally, we observed that behavioral performance measures correlated with changes in EEG alpha power of the N-back and the Ospan, yet not of the Dspan. Taken together, the hypothesized conceptual commonalities between the N-back task and the Ospan (and, for the Dspan, differences) were only partly confirmed by the electrophysiological WM load-related measures, indicating a potential need for reconsidering the theoretical accounts on WM tasks and the value of a closer link to electrophysiological research herein.},

However, until now it has not been differentiated between primary influences of weightlessness and secondary influences due to psycho-physiological factors (e.g., physical or mental strain). With the aim of detecting parabolic flight related changes in central cortical activity, a resting EEG was deduced in 16 subjects before, during and after parabolic flights. After subdividing EEG into alpha-, beta-,delta- and theta-wave bands, an increase in beta-power was noticeable inflight, whereas alpha(1)-power was increased postflight. No changes could be observed for the control group. To control possible effects of cortical activation, a manual tracking task with mirror inversion was performed during either the phase of weightlessness or during the normal gravity phase of a parabolic flight. No differences in performance nor in adaptation could be observed between both groups. A third group, performing under normal and stress-free conditions in a lab showed similar tracking values. We assume that the specific increase in brain activity is a sign of an increase in arousal inflight. This does support previous assumptions of non-specific stressors during parabolic flights and has to be considered as a relevant factor for experiments on central nerve adaptation. Although no influences of stress and/or weightlessness on motor performance and adaptation could be observed, we suggest that an "inflight" control group seems to be more adequate than a laboratory control group to investigate gravity-dependent changes in motor control.},

Several studies have reported impairment of central nervous processes during weightlessness. There is ongoing debate as to whether these impairments are attributable to primary physiological effects or secondary psychological effects of the weightlessness environment. This study evaluates the physiological effects of changed gravity conditions on brain cortical activity. In a first experiment, EEG activity of seven participants was recorded at normal, increased and zero gravity during a parabolic flight. Additionally an EEG under normal gravity conditions preflight was recorded. In a second experiment, 24 participants were exposed to a supine, seated and 9 degree head-down tilt position while EEG was recorded. Data were analysed using low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Beta-2 EEG activity (18-35 Hz) was found to be increased in the right superior frontal gyrus under normal gravity conditions inflight. By exposure to weightlessness a distinct inhibition of this activity within the same areas could be noticed. As the tilt experiment showed changes in the left inferior temporal gyrus in supine and tilted positions we conclude that the observed changes under weightlessness are not explainable by hemodynamic changes but rather reflect emotional processes related to the experience of weightlessness. These findings suggest that weightlessness has a major impact on electro cortical activity and may affect central nervous and adaptation processes.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Previous event-related potential (ERP) research on inhibitory functioning in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD) has often failed to use tasks which optimally assess inhibition. We report on an improved measure of inhibitory function, involving inhibition of a prepotent response, in children with AD/HD.
METHODS: Twelve males with AD/HD and 12 control males, aged 7-12 years, completed a cued Go/NoGo task where Go stimuli were presented on 70\% of trials. ERP and behavioural measures were collected, together with reading, spelling and full-scale IQ scores.
RESULTS: The behavioural performance of children with AD/HD was not significantly different from normal controls, although children with AD/HD made faster responses and more errors. Group differences were apparent in the early processing components (P1, N1, P2) of responses to Warning, Go and NoGo stimuli. For the frontally maximal N2, a NoGo{$>$}Go effect was found, consistent with previous work linking this component with inhibitory processing. In control children this effect was particularly strong in the right frontal region, while children with AD/HD showed a much larger NoGo{$>$}Go effect, and an earlier N2 peak, than controls, with a focal shift to the left frontal region.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with normal controls, children with AD/HD demonstrate early stimulus processing atypicalities, suggesting problems with sensory registration and identification of stimuli. Further, N2 results suggest that children with AD/HD must trigger the inhibition process earlier and more strongly than controls to perform at a comparable behavioural level.
SIGNIFICANCE: The results support the theory that behavioural inhibition is deficient in AD/HD, as children with AD/HD show abnormalities in inhibitory ERP components relating to the effort involved in inhibiting a prepotent response.},

  abstract = {Artificial gravity has been proposed as a method to counteract the physiological deconditioning of long-duration spaceflight; however, the effects of hypergravity on the central nervous system has had little study. The study aims to investigate whether there is a relationship between prefrontal cortex brain activity and prefrontal cortex oxygenation during exposure to hypergravity. Twelve healthy participants were selected to undergo hypergravity exposure aboard a short-arm human centrifuge. Participants were exposed to hypergravity in the +Gz axis, starting from 0.6 +Gz for women, and 0.8 +Gz for men, and gradually increasing by 0.1 +Gz until the participant showed signs of syncope. Brain cortical activity was measured using electroencephalography (EEG) and localized to the prefrontal cortex using standard low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Prefrontal cortex oxygenation was measured using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). A significant increase in prefrontal cortex activity ( P {$<$} 0.05) was observed during hypergravity exposure compared with baseline. Prefrontal cortex oxygenation was significantly decreased during hypergravity exposure, with a decrease in oxyhemoglobin levels ( P {$<$} 0.05) compared with baseline and an increase in deoxyhemoglobin levels ( P {$<$} 0.05) with increasing +Gz level. No significant correlation was found between prefrontal cortex activity and oxy-/deoxyhemoglobin. It is concluded that the increase in prefrontal cortex activity observed during hypergravity was most likely not the result of increased +Gz values resulting in a decreased oxygenation produced through hypergravity exposure. No significant relationship between prefrontal cortex activity and oxygenation measured by NIRS concludes that brain activity during exposure to hypergravity may be difficult to measure using NIRS. Instead, the increase in prefrontal cortex activity might be attributable to psychological stress, which could pose a problem for the use of a short-arm human centrifuge as a countermeasure.},

Mean blood pressure (MBP) and heart rate (HR) were measured continuously. Nine young healthy volunteers (mean age 23) were included in the analysis. Significant task related changes were observed in both the NIRS and systemic signals during the anagram solving with increases in [HbO2] and [HHb] accompanied by changes in MBP and HR. The [HbO2] and [HHb] signals measured over the frontal region were found to have a varying association with the MBP signal across different volunteers. The effect of these systemic changes on measured NIRS signals must be considered},

  abstract = {Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive method to measure brain activities using the changes of optical absorption in the brain through the intact skull. fNIRS has many advantages over other neuroimaging modalities such as positron emission tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), or magnetoencephalography (MEG), since it can directly measure blood oxygenation level changes related to neural activation with high temporal resolution. However, fNIRS signals are highly corrupted by measurement noises and physiology-based systemic interference. Careful statistical analyses are therefore required to extract neuronal activity-related signals from fNIRS data. In this paper, we provide an extensive review of historical developments of statistical analyses of fNIRS signal, which include motion artifact correction, short source-detector separation correction, principal component analysis (PCA)/independent component analysis (ICA), false discovery rate (FDR), serially-correlated errors, as well as inference techniques such as the standard t-test, F-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and statistical parameter mapping (SPM) framework. In addition, to provide a unified view of various existing inference techniques, we explain a linear mixed effect model with restricted maximum likelihood (ReML) variance estimation, and show that most of the existing inference methods for fNIRS analysis can be derived as special cases. Some of the open issues in statistical analysis are also described.},

Some of these LFOs are nonneuronal and are closely related to autonomic physiological processes. In the current study, we conducted a concurrent resting-state fMRI and NIRS experiment with healthy volunteers. LFO data was collected simultaneously at peripheral sites (middle fingertip and big toes) by NIRS, and centrally in the brain by BOLD fMRI. The cross-correlations of the LFOs collected from the finger, toes, and brain were calculated. Our data show that the LFOs measured in the periphery (NIRS signals) and in the brain (BOLD fMRI) were strongly correlated with varying time delays. This demonstrates that some portion of the LFOs actually reflect systemic physiological circulatory effects. Furthermore, we demonstrated that NIRS is effective for measuring the peripheral LFOs, and that these LFOs and the temporal shifts between them are consistent in healthy participants and may serve as useful biomarkers for detecting and monitoring circulatory dysfunction.},

  abstract = {Independent component analysis (ICA) is widely used in resting state functional connectivity studies. ICA is a data-driven method, which uses no a priori anatomical or functional assumptions. However, as a result, it still relies on the user to distinguish the independent components (ICs) corresponding to neuronal activation, peripherally originating signals (without directly attributable neuronal origin, such as respiration, cardiac pulsation and Mayer wave), and acquisition artifacts. In this concurrent near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)/functional MRI (fMRI) resting state study, we developed a method to systematically and quantitatively identify the ICs that show strong contributions from signals originating in the periphery. We applied group ICA (MELODIC from FSL) to the resting state data of 10 healthy participants. The systemic low frequency oscillation (LFO) detected simultaneously at each participant's fingertip by NIRS was used as a regressor to correlate with every subject-specific IC time course. The ICs that had high correlation with the systemic LFO were those closely associated with previously described sensorimotor, visual, and auditory networks. The ICs associated with the default mode and frontoparietal networks were less affected by the peripheral signals. The consistency and reproducibility of the results were evaluated using bootstrapping. This result demonstrates that systemic, low frequency oscillations in hemodynamic properties overlay the time courses of many spatial patterns identified in ICA analyses, which complicates the detection and interpretation of connectivity in these regions of the brain.},

  abstract = {Advances in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) acquisition have improved signal to noise to the point where the physiology of the subject is the dominant noise source in resting state fMRI data (rsfMRI). Among these systemic, non-neuronal physiological signals, respiration and to some degree cardiac fluctuations can be removed through modeling, or in the case of newer, faster acquisitions such as simultaneous multislice acquisition, simple spectral filtering. However, significant low frequency physiological oscillation ({$\sim$}0.01\textendash{}0.15 Hz) remains in the signal. This is problematic, as it is the precise frequency band occupied by the neuronally modulated hemodynamic responses used to study brain connectivity, precluding its removal by spectral filtering. The source of this signal, and its method of production and propagation in the body, have not been conclusively determined. Here, we summarize the defining characteristics of the systemic low frequency noise signal, and review some current theories about the signal source and the evidence supporting them. The strength and distribution of the systemic LFO signal make characterizing and removing it essential for accurate quantification, especially for resting state connectivity, when no stimulation can be compared with the signal. Widespread correlated non-neuronal signals obscure and distort the more localized patterns of neuronal correlations between interacting brain regions; they may even cause apparent connectivity between regions with no neuronal interaction. Here, we discuss a simple method we have developed to parse the global, moving, blood-borne signal from the stationary, neuronal connectivity signals, substantially reducing the negative correlations that result from global signal regression. Finally, we will discuss some of the uses to which the moving systemic low frequency oscillation can be put if we consider it a ``signal'' carrying information, rather than simply ``noise'' complicating the interpretation of resting state connectivity. Properly utilizing this signal may offer insights into subtle hemodynamic alterations that can be used as early indicators of circulatory dysfunction in a number of neuropsychiatric conditions, such as prodromal stroke, moyamoya, and Alzheimer's disease.},

Consequently, long-duration space travel can have detrimental effects on human physiology. Although research has focused on the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal system in particular, the exact impact of spaceflight on the human central nervous system remains to be determined. Previous studies have reported psychological problems, cephalic fluid shifts, neurovestibular problems, and cognitive alterations, but there is paucity in the knowledge of the underlying neural substrates. Previous space analogue studies and preliminary spaceflight studies have shown an involvement of the cerebellum, cortical sensorimotor, and somatosensory areas and the vestibular pathways. Extending this knowledge is crucial, especially in view of long-duration interplanetary missions (e.g., Mars missions) and space tourism. In addition, the acquired insight could be relevant for vestibular patients, patients with neurodegenerative disorders, as well as the elderly population, coping with multisensory deficit syndromes, immobilization, and inactivity.},

  abstract = {Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is a widely used technique for mapping the brain's functional architecture, so delineating the main sources of variance comprising the signal is crucial. Low frequency oscillations (LFO) that are not of neural origin, but which are driven by mechanisms related to cerebral autoregulation (CA), are present in the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal within the rs-fMRI frequency band. In this study we use a MR compatible device (Caretaker, Biopac) to obtain a non-invasive estimate of beat-to-beat mean arterial pressure (MAP) fluctuations concurrently with rs-fMRI at 3T. Healthy adult subjects (n=9; 5 male) completed two 20-minute rs-fMRI scans. MAP fluctuations were decomposed into different frequency scales using a discrete wavelet transform, and oscillations at approximately 0.1Hz show a high degree of spatially structured correlations with matched frequency fMRI fluctuations. On average across subjects, MAP fluctuations at this scale of the wavelet decomposition explain \textasciitilde{} 2.2\% of matched frequency fMRI signal variance. Additionally, a simultaneous multi-slice multi-echo acquisition was used to collect 10-minute rs-fMRI at three echo times at 7T in a separate group of healthy adults (n=5; 5 male). Multiple echo times were used to estimate the R2* decay at every time point, and MAP was shown to strongly correlate with this signal, which suggests a purely BOLD (i.e. blood flow related) origin. This study demonstrates that there is a significant component of the BOLD signal that has a systemic physiological origin, and highlights the fact that not all localized BOLD signal changes necessarily reflect blood flow supporting local neural activity. Instead, these data show that a proportion of BOLD signal fluctuations in rs-fMRI are due to localized control of blood flow that is independent of local neural activity, most likely reflecting more general systemic autoregulatory processes. Thus, fMRI is a promising tool for studying flow changes associated with cerebral autoregulation with high spatial resolution.},

While findings to date are quite inconsistent, studies reporting a decrement in cognitive performance have generally not been able to distinguish between the direct influence of microgravity, and any associated influence of stress. Furthermore, the currently available findings are primarily based on behavioral observations, and there is a need to better understand the underlying neurophysiological responses. The current study aimed to determine the effects of microgravity on neurophysiological processing during a mental arithmetic task (executive function). During the normal- and microgravity phases of a parabolic flight, four levels of a mental arithmetic task were presented on a touchscreen tablet. The latency between the appearance of the problem and the participants' response was identified as reaction time. In addition visual evoked potentials N1 and P2 were determined using an active EEG system and analyzed using source localization algorithms. Results showed an increase in reaction time with increasing levels of task difficulty. During the most complex levels, reaction time was significantly reduced during microgravity. This observation was independent of previous parabolic flight experience as well as the use of anti-motion-sickness medication. P2 amplitude decrease during microgravity was concomitant to a related involvement of the superior frontal and medial frontal gyrus. It is concluded that cortical processes are enhanced during microgravity, and that previously reported impairments in cognitive performance are likely attributable to increased stress rather than weightlessness itself.},

They are believed to play important roles in mechanosensitive pathways by allowing for cells to sense their mechanical environment. However, the physiological function of many MSCs has not been conclusively identified. Therefore, experiments have been developed that expose cells to various mechanical loads, such as shear flow, membrane indentation, osmotic challenges and hydrostatic pressure. In line with these experiments, mechanical unloading, as experienced in microgravity, represents an interesting alternative condition, since exposure to microgravity leads to a series of physiological adaption processes. As outlined in this review, electrophysiological experiments performed in microgravity have shown an influence of gravity on biological functions depending on ion channels at all hierarchical levels, from the cellular level to organs. In this context, calcium signaling represents an interesting cellular pathway, as it involves the direct action of calcium-permeable ion channels, and specific gravitatic cells have linked graviperception to this pathway. Multiple key proteins in the graviperception pathways have been identified. However, measurements on vertebrae cells have revealed controversial results. In conclusion, electrophysiological experiments in microgravity have shown that ion-channel-dependent physiological processes are altered in mechanically unloaded conditions. Future experiments may provide a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms.},

Psychological and endocrinal measurements confirmed significantly higher levels of long-term stress for participants in the exam group.

  abstract = {Linear regression with short source-detector separation channels (S-channels) as references is an efficient way to overcome significant physiological interference from the superficial layer for functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). However, the co-located configuration of S-channels and long source-detector separation channels (L-channels) is difficult to achieve in practice. In this study, we recorded superficial interference with S-channels in multiple scalp regions. We found that superficial interference has overall frequency-specific and globally symmetrical patterns. The performance of linear regression is also dependent on these patterns, indicating the possibility of simplifying the S-channel configurations for multiregional fNIRS imaging.},

  abstract = {The development of a whole-scalp, high sampling-density diffuse optical tomography (DOT) system is a critical next step in the evolution of the field of diffuse optics. To achieve this with optical fiber bundles is extremely challenging, simply because of the sheer number of bundles required, and the associated challenges of weight and ergonomics. Dispensing with optical fiber bundles and moving to head-mounted optoelectronics can potentially facilitate the advent of a new generation of wearable, whole-scalp technologies that will open up a range of new experimental and clinical applications for diffuse optical measurements. Here, we present a concise review of the significant progress that has been made toward achieving a wearable, fiberless, high-density, whole-scalp DOT system. We identify the key limitations of current technologies and discuss the possible opportunities for future development.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Affective disorders (AD) have been conceptualized as neural network-level diseases. In this study, we utilized functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to investigate the spontaneous hemodynamic activities in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of the AD patients with or without medications.
METHODS: 42 optical channels were applied to cover the superior frontal gyrus (SFG), middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), which constitute one of the most important affective networks of the brain. We performed resting-state measurements on 28 patients who were diagnosed as having AD and 30 healthy controls (HC). Raw fNIRS data were preprocessed with independent component analysis (ICA) and a band-pass filter to remove artifacts and physiological noise.
RESULTS: By systematically analyzing the intra-regional, intrahemispheric, and interhemispheric connectivities based on the spontaneous oscillations of {$\Delta$}[HbO], our results indicated that patients with AD exhibited significantly reduced intra-regional and symmetrically interhemispheric connectivities in the PFC when compared to HC. More specifically, relative to HC, AD patients showed significantly lower locally functional connectivity in the right IFG, and poor long-distance connectivity between bilateral IFG. In addition, AD patients without medication presented more disrupted cortical organizations in the PFC, and the severity of self-reported symptoms of depression was negatively correlated with the strength of intra-regional and symmetrically interhemispheric connectivity in the PFC.
LIMITATIONS: Regarding the measuring technique, fNIRS has restricted measurement depth and spatial resolution. During the study, the subgroups of AD, such as major depressive disorder, bipolar, comorbidity, or non-comorbidity, dosage of psychotropic drugs, as well as different types of pharmacological responses were not distinguished and systematically compared. Furthermore, due to the limitation of the research design, it was still not very clear how pharmacological treatment affected the resting state cortical organization of the prefrontal lobe, and the degree of the effect in patients with AD.
CONCLUSION: These results strongly supported that RSFC measured by fNIRS could be a useful and powerful way of delineating the neuropathology of AD.},
