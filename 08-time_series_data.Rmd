Working with Time Series Data

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
timeseries <- ts(myDataFrame)
```

## Results

There was a significant effect of service on the average journey time 

````{r, echo=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
r describe.aov(model, "service", sstype = 2)
```

### Referencing a table 

Descriptive statistics were run and are shown in Table \@ref(tab:journeyTime) below 
```{r journeyTime}
knitr::kable(iris, longtable=T, caption = "Descriptives")
```

### Referencing a Figure 

```{r myFigure, fig.cap = "Caption for my Figure"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/plot1.png")
```

A plot is shown in  Figure \@ref(fig:myFigure)
